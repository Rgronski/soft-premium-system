# Future Releases

Future releases should summarize completed milestones rather than individual implementation details whenever possible.

Each release should clearly communicate what value was delivered.

---

# Maintenance Rules

The Change Log should be updated:

* after milestone completion,
* after significant architectural changes,
* after official releases.

Routine development commits do not require individual Change Log entries unless they represent meaningful project progress.
