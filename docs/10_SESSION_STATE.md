# Purpose

This document records the latest known working session state.

It helps the Product Owner and AI resume work safely in a new chat without relying only on conversation history.

This document is an operational snapshot for SPS OS session continuity.

This document describes session continuity. It does not replace:

* `08_CURRENT_STATE.md` for product status,
* `09_CHANGELOG.md` for completed historical changes,
* `06_BACKLOG.md` for candidate future work.

It is not:

* a changelog,
* a roadmap,
* a session handoff,
* an implementation report,
* an audit transcript.

It should answer only:

* What is active now?
* What was just completed?
* What is next?
* What is the verified repository state?
* What is blocked or unknown?
* What is the one Next Safe Step?

It should also record who owned diagnosis, implementation, verification, and repository actions when responsibilities are split between ChatGPT / Chief Architect, Codex, and Product Owner.

Session Close should leave enough confirmed information here to support the next session's Project Integrity Check.

# Session State Contract

Allowed fields:

* date
* current session id
* current chat title
* next session id
* suggested next chat title
* active capability
* active work item
* current mode
* completed capability items
* current product milestone
* next product milestone
* active parallel capability
* latest completed capability item
* current sprint
* platform priority
* repository branch
* repository working tree state
* ahead / behind status
* latest verified commit
* verification status
* blockers
* open risks
* next safe step

Forbidden content:

* long narrative summaries
* historical changelog entries
* roadmap planning
* implementation details
* complete handoff text
* speculative future work
* unverified claims

Evidence rules:

* use confirmed terminal output
* use committed documentation
* use explicit Codex output
* use `sps-git-context.txt` if available
* use `UNKNOWN` when evidence is missing

Latest Verified Commit semantics:

* `Latest Verified Commit` means the last confirmed verification baseline commit
* it does not need to equal the current Package HEAD
* it must exist in the repository
* it must be the same commit as Package HEAD or an ancestor of Package HEAD
* Package HEAD is read from Git during package generation
* Package HEAD is not a manual Session State field that requires another commit to keep updating

Session Start Repository HEAD records the repository commit verified when the current session snapshot was established. It does not need to equal later commits created during the same session.

Update timing:

* update during `SPS OS - KONIEC`
* update after Session Audit
* update before Session Handoff
* update before the next START package

Deterministic Session State update template:

```text

Next Session ID: [VALUE OR UNKNOWN]
Suggested Next Chat Title: [VALUE OR UNKNOWN]

# Operational Session Identity

Session State is the SSOT for operational SPS session identity.

Use these fields:

* Current Session ID
* Current Chat Title
* Next Session ID
* Suggested Next Chat Title

If no confirmed session number exists yet, use `UNKNOWN`.

The Suggested Next Chat Title is official SPS OS guidance only. It does not guarantee that the ChatGPT UI title was changed.

---

# Session State And Handoff Boundary

Session State is the current operational snapshot.

Session Handoff is the transfer package for the next chat.

Session State must not contain the full handoff body.

Full handoff contract lives in `docs/session-handoffs/README.md`.

---

# Session State And Package Boundary

Session State may be summarized into `sps-session-summary.txt` by the future package generator.

Session State remains the source operational snapshot.

The generator must not invent missing state.

# Latest Session

SPS OS Session State

Date: 2026-07-23
Current Session ID: 016
Current Chat Title: 016 SPS OS - MS-001.24 Local Secret Setup Discovery
Next Session ID: 017
Suggested Next Chat Title: 017 SPS OS - MS-001.24 Server Consumer Integration Discovery
Active Capability: NONE
Active Work Item: Session Close Protocol
Current Mode: SESSION CLOSED
Completed Capability Items: MS-001.24 Local Secret Setup; MS-001.24 Minimal Projects Schema; MS-001.24 Existing Project Seed Record; MS-001.24 First Read-Only Server Client Batch; MS-001.24 Live Read Verification
Current Product Milestone: MS-001.24 - Server-Readable Read-Only Project Context Foundation
Next Product Milestone: MS-001.23 - AI Model Production Provider Foundation (resume after MS-001.24)
Active Parallel Capability: NONE
Latest Completed Capability Item: CAP-005 - React Component Test Infrastructure Foundation
Current Sprint: NONE
Platform Priority: Keep MS-001.24 active while connecting the verified read-only Neon Project identity repository to exactly one server-side consumer without expanding persistence scope
Repository Branch: main
Repository Working Tree State: CLEAN
Ahead / Behind Status: 0 / 0
Latest Verified Commit: 9c9b8a2
Verification Status: PASS - local secret setup verified, manual Neon schema and seed record verified, focused server repository tests `2 / 2` PASS, scoped ESLint PASS, and live read through `getServerProjectById()` PASS; live OpenAI verification remains NOT PERFORMED
Blockers: MS-001.23 remains blocked by MS-001.24 until one existing server-side consumer uses the verified read-only Neon project repository
Open Risks: hydration mismatch was noticed during local dev runtime and was not diagnosed in this session; browser project reads still use localStorage; AI route does not yet use the Neon Project repository; `Deployment Architecture Discovery - OVH VPS + Coolify + Neon` remains pending discovery only and is not an accepted ADR
Next Safe Step: Przeprowadzić discovery minimalnego patcha podłączającego getServerProjectById() do jednego istniejącego konsumenta serwerowego, preferencyjnie AI route, bez zmian w UI i bez zapisu do bazy.
