# Purpose

This document records the latest known working session state.

It helps the Product Owner and AI resume work safely in a new chat without relying only on conversation history.

This document is an operational snapshot for SPS OS session continuity.

This document describes session continuity. It does not replace:

* `08_CURRENT_STATE.md` for product status,
* `09_CHANGELOG.md` for completed historical changes,
* `06_BACKLOG.md` for candidate future work.

It is not:

* a changelog,
* a roadmap,
* a session handoff,
* an implementation report,
* an audit transcript.

It should answer only:

* What is active now?
* What was just completed?
* What is next?
* What is the verified repository state?
* What is blocked or unknown?
* What is the one Next Safe Step?
* What is the mandatory Next Session Plan?

It should also record who owned diagnosis, implementation, verification, and repository actions when responsibilities are split between ChatGPT / Chief Architect, Codex, and Product Owner.

Session Close should leave enough confirmed information here to support the next session's Project Integrity Check.

# Session State Contract

Allowed fields:

* date
* current session id
* current chat title
* next session id
* suggested next chat title
* active capability
* active work item
* current mode
* completed capability items
* current product milestone
* next product milestone
* active parallel capability
* latest completed capability item
* current sprint
* platform priority
* repository branch
* repository working tree state
* ahead / behind status
* latest verified commit
* verification status
* blockers
* open risks
* next session plan
* next safe step

Forbidden content:

* long narrative summaries
* historical changelog entries
* roadmap planning
* implementation details
* complete handoff text
* speculative future work
* unverified claims

Evidence rules:

* use confirmed terminal output
* use committed documentation
* use explicit Codex output
* use `sps-git-context.txt` if available
* use `UNKNOWN` when evidence is missing

Latest Verified Commit semantics:

* `Latest Verified Commit` means the last confirmed verification baseline commit
* it does not need to equal the current Package HEAD
* it must exist in the repository
* it must be the same commit as Package HEAD or an ancestor of Package HEAD
* Package HEAD is read from Git during package generation
* Package HEAD is not a manual Session State field that requires another commit to keep updating

Session Start Repository HEAD records the repository commit verified when the current session snapshot was established. It does not need to equal later commits created during the same session.

Update timing:

* update during `SPS OS - KONIEC`
* update after Session Audit
* update before Session Handoff
* update before the next START package

Deterministic Session State update template:

```text

# Operational Session Identity

Session State is the SSOT for operational SPS session identity.

Use these fields:

* Current Session ID
* Current Chat Title
* Next Session ID
* Suggested Next Chat Title

If no confirmed session number exists yet, use `UNKNOWN`.

The Suggested Next Chat Title is official SPS OS guidance only. It does not guarantee that the ChatGPT UI title was changed.

---

# Session State And Handoff Boundary

Session State is the current operational snapshot.

Session Handoff is the transfer package for the next chat.

Session State must not contain the full handoff body.

Full handoff contract lives in `docs/session-handoffs/README.md`.

---

# Session State And Package Boundary

Session State may be summarized into `sps-session-summary.txt` by the future package generator.

Session State remains the source operational snapshot.

The generator must not invent missing state.
